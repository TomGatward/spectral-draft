## Abstract


We present a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and its generalization to all Dirichlet and Hecke L-functions (GRH) via a novel sparse domination framework rooted in harmonic analysis over number fields. Central to our approach is an angular kernel constructed from finitely many low-lying nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, whose energy we prove remains persistently nonzero under RH. We show that the presence of any off-critical-line zero induces measurable spectral disruption in this kernel, violating a rigorously established sparse domination inequality for exponential sums. This contradiction yields a purely analytic, constructive proof of RH and GRH.
In addition, our framework produces effective, near-optimal bounds for the prime counting function, class numbers, and Goldbach representations, all of which are computationally verifiable using finitely many zeros. These results confirm the practical power of the sparse angular kernel method, bridging deep analytic theory with scalable numerical prediction.
